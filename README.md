# Eric Johnson's Github 

## Bio 

 I am recent aerospace engineering graduate focused on GNC and robotics. My passion is centered around small UAS and autonomous flight. I am excited about the new found capabilities this technology will bring and the impact it will have in helping elevate the world's standard of living.  

 At the beginning of 2017 I helped found the student group Texas Aerial Robotics at the University of Texas at Austin. This group is dedicated to competing in the International Aerial Robotics Competition.  The team researches fields such as computer vision, parallel computing, computational modeling, AI, guidance, navigation and control as is applied to drones.

 My main side project at the moment is my youtube channel/Github Intelligent Quads.  This channel is focused on making educational drone content primarily focused on open source software development for drones. The content is derived from the lessons and skills I helped develop at Texas Aerial Robotics.  

## Checkout Intelligent Quads

Intelligent Quads is community dedicated to helping people become developers of autonomous drone applications. My youtube channel primarily creates tutorials over ardupilot, mavros, yolo and other open source software useful for drone applications.
